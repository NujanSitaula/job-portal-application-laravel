## About JobScout

JobScout is a Laravel-based web application designed to serve as a job portal for job seekers and employers. It is currently under development as a Final Year Project at Herald College Kathmandu, with the aim of providing a simple and efficient platform to connect job seekers with potential employers.

The application features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and find relevant job postings. Job seekers can create their profiles, upload their resumes, and search for job listings based on various criteria such as location, industry, experience, and job type. They can also receive job alerts and notifications when new job listings that match their preferences are posted.

Employers can create their profiles, post job listings, and search for candidates based on various criteria such as location, experience, and education. They can also receive candidate applications, manage and communicate with applicants, and schedule interviews.

I am currently working on implementing features like blog system, login via OTP and SMS authentication. 

## Packages Used (Till Date)

* axios: A Promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript. It is used in this project to make API requests to the Laravel backend.

* laravel-vite-plugin: A Vite plugin specifically designed for Laravel projects. It provides features such as automatic asset versioning and Laravel Mix-like asset building, among others.

* lodash: A JavaScript utility library that provides a variety of helpful functions for working with arrays, objects, and strings. It is used in this project to simplify certain operations and improve code readability.

* postcss: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript. It is used in this project to preprocess CSS, apply vendor prefixes, and optimize styles.

* vite: A build tool and development server for modern web projects. It is used in this project as the main development server and build tool for the frontend.

These packages are the default ones that come with Laravel, and as of now, no additional packages have been added. However, as the development progresses, I plan to incorporate additional packages and will update accordingly.
